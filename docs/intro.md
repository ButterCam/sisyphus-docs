# Introduce

‚ö°Ô∏è Sisyphus can help you quickly build cloud-native modern backend services.

üèó Sisyphus uses a 'macroservices' design philosophy, which allows you to focus on business logic at the beginning of a
project and easily unpack it into microservices at a later stage of business expansion.

üìì Follow the [Google API Improvement Proposals](https://google.aip.dev/) for a handy guide to building robust and
extensible APIs.

üí• Ready for more? Use advanced features like Service Reflection, Swagger Integration, Service Monitoring, SQL Builder
DSL and more!

üßê Sisyphus is essentially a gRPC service framework built on Spring Boot and Kotlin, using Kotlin Coroutine technology to
build asynchronous APIs.

# Features

Sisyphus has been designed from the ground up with a strong focus on the developer experience, helping you take a break
from the tedium of business code.

- ü•Ñ **Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è and Kotlin**
  - Develop with the more efficient Kotlin language
  - Embrace the Java community, 100% compatibility with Java libraries
  - Write high performance and very readable business logic using Kotlin concurrency techniques
- üßó‚Äç **Integration into the Protobuf/gRPC ecosystem**
  - Kotlin-specific Protobuf compiler to seamlessly integrate Protobuf into the Kotlin language system
  - [Intellij Protobuf Plugin](https://github.com/devkanro/intellij-protobuf-plugin), which supports the Sisyphus
    framework, helps you write Protobuf files quickly
  - Charles on gRPC, the [Mediator](https://github.com/ButterCam/Mediator) proxy tool can help you debug gRPC services
  - The minimalist gRPC client for Web [sisyphus.js](https://github.com/ButterCam/sisyphus.js) helps you quickly
    integrate into the browser
- üó∫ **Follow the [Google API Improvement Proposals](https://google.aip.dev/)**
  - When on the fence about API design, feel free to turn to the Google API Improvement Proposals
  - Provides HTTP and gRPC Transcoding implementation, implementing both gRPC and beautiful Restful API at once
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Native microservices**
  - Microservices and Macroservices can be assembled at will, retaining the features of microservices while including
    the benefits of monolithic applications
  - Deployment Plugin One-Click Deployment to K8s Environment
  - Docker plugin supports layered builds using Spring Boot layered Jar to optimize image size
- üë¨ **Developer Friendly**
  - Doing the most with the least configuration
  - Configure the development environment using the readily editable gradle.properties
  - Configure the runtime environment using the distributable Config Artifacts Jar
